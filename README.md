AppStarter is a simple Windows application built using the WPF framework that allows you batch start a list of Windows applications.  Add applications and select which ones you want to start.  For convenience, program selection persists across sessions.

This application was created because I now work from home on my home desktop.  Before Covid I'd just shut my work laptop at the end of the day then walk in the next morning and open it up and pick up exactly where I left off.  These days at the end of each work day I shut down all my programming applications and have to start them all back up again in the morning.  It was a pain!
